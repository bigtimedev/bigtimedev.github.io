## The Website

0. We're in love
0. To use this, start by cloning the repo somewhere unimportant (`git clone https://github.com/bigtimedev/bigtimedev.github.io`)
0. Then go into the repository (`cd bigtimedev.github.io`) babe I love you
0. Then install all dependencies (`yarn install` is faster than `npm install` but whatever floats your boat should work just fine)
0. Do your development. (A bunch of commands probably)
0. Compile everything (`gulp`)
0. Commit (`git add . && git commit` then type your message into nano or what-have-you)
0. Love each other more!
